# name-generator
This is a very simple project that creates words randomly. Which can be useful for not wasting time with finding a name for a new project.

# Algorithm & Usage
The algorithm is very simple. It takes max, min length and starts with (optional) parameters. Then if you have specified starts with parameter, it will start with it or it will select a random letter to start with. Then we find out if this letter is a vowel or a consonant. If it is a vowel, we add a random consonant to the word. If it is a consonant, we add a random vowel to the word and that's it (for now).

In the future, we will try to make the algorithm better. We will make an API, an npm module and make it more user friendly.
